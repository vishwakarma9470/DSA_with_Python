# 🐍 Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (Basic to Advanced)

Welcome to my DSA repository! 🚀

This repository documents my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **Python**. It contains clean, efficient, and well-documented code ranging from basic Python concepts to complex algorithmic problems.

## 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Understand the core logic behind data structures.
- Prepare for coding interviews (FAANG & Product-based companies).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into the following categories:

### 🟢 1. Basics of Python
- Syntax, Loops, Functions
- OOPs Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
- Exception Handling

### 🟡 2. Data Structures
- **Linear:** Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, Queues
- **Non-Linear:** Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL), Heaps, Graphs, Hash Maps

### 🔴 3. Algorithms
- **Sorting:** Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort
- **Searching:** Linear & Binary Search
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal's

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
